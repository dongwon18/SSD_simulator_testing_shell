	index range: 0 ~ 99
	value: 32 bit  hex value in upper case letter
	SSD state will be stored in ./ssd/nand.txt
	example: write 3 0xAAAABBBB

$read [index to be read]
	index range: 0 ~ 99
	result will be stored in ./ssd/result.txt
	example: read 3

$fullwrite [value to be written]
	write the value to all SSD LBA
	SSD state will be stored in ./ssd/nand.txt
	example: fullwrite 0x12345678

$fullread
	read value of LBA 0 ~ 99
	result will be stored in ./ssd/result.txt
	result only include the last result which is the value of LBA 99
	example: fullread

$testapp[number]
	run test scenario [number]
	print result of the test by comparing target answer and real value in LBA

$clear
	set all LBA value to 0x00000000

$exit
	terminate the shell
